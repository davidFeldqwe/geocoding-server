In light of octeber 7, we initiated a project in collaboration with Waze, which maps thousands of public safety shelters throughout the country. The project aims to make it easier for citizens to locate public safety shelters in their vicinity at any given moment and reduce the sense of insecurity in public spaces.

> [!WARNING]
> this is experimental and WIP & The project is on freeze פיקוד העורף doesnt allow wase to upload the shelters
